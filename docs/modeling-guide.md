# Modeling Guide for DevOps and SRE Observability

This guide explains how **Quantitative Modeling** techniques (Linear, Power, Exponential, and Logarithmic) are applied to observability metrics in real-world microservices environments using Prometheus, Grafana, and Kibana.

---

## Why Apply Quantitative Models to Observability?

- **Detect problems earlier** by spotting non-linear patterns.
- **Improve alert accuracy** by matching alert logic to system behavior.
- **Plan capacity and scaling** with realistic growth projections.
- **Understand performance limits** before users are impacted.

## Modeling Types and When to Use Them

| Model Type | When to Use | Key Metrics Examples |
|:-----------|:------------|:---------------------|
| **Linear** | Systems where resource usage or load grows steadily over time. | CPU usage, memory usage, HTTP request rate |
| **Power** | Systems where performance degrades faster than load increases. | Response times under heavy traffic, DB query latency |
| **Exponential** | When failures or errors grow very rapidly if left unchecked. | 5xx server errors, application exception rates |
| **Logarithmic** | When improvements slow down over time after initial optimizations. | Latency after tuning efforts, optimization tracking |

## Metric Behaviors and Matching Models

- **CPU usage rising proportionally with traffic → Linear**
- **Latency growing faster than traffic → Power**
- **Errors exploding after a small anomaly → Exponential**
- **Optimizations yielding diminishing returns → Logarithmic**

Matching the right model makes monitoring smarter and more predictive.

## How Models Are Applied in Tools

| Tool | How It Supports Modeling |
|:-----|:-------------------------|
| **Prometheus** | Functions like `rate()`, `increase()`, `exp()`, and `log()` enable modeling directly on metrics. |
| **Grafana** | Visual panels with linear scales, log scales, power trend expressions, and threshold alerts. |
| **Kibana** | Lens visualizations, scripted fields (e.g., `Math.log()`, `Math.pow()`), and runtime fields for transformations. |

## Practical Examples

- **Linear**: Plot HTTP request rate using `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`.
- **Power**: Create custom math in Grafana: `metric ^ 1.5` to model growing bottlenecks.
- **Exponential**: Visualize 5xx errors with Prometheus: `exp(rate(error_total[5m]))`.
- **Logarithmic**: Apply log scale Y-axis in Kibana/Grafana to compress latency charts after optimization.

## Key Takeaways

- Always **start simple** (Linear) and move toward **Power** or **Exponential** only when needed.
- Use **logarithmic views** when your metrics show **flattening or slow improvement** trends.
- Set thresholds wisely based on the **shape** of the metric growth (not just absolute numbers).
- Understand **real system behavior** before setting alerts or capacity plans.
