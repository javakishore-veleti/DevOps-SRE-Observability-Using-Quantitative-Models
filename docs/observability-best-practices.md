# Observability Best Practices for DevOps and SRE

This document outlines key best practices for setting up and maintaining effective observability systems across microservices environments.

Strong observability is not just about collecting metrics and logs, but about **understanding system behavior** and **predicting failures before they happen**.

---

## 1. Model Metrics Based on System Behavior

- Apply **quantitative modeling** (Linear, Power, Exponential, Logarithmic) to analyze metric trends.
- Identify **expected growth patterns** for key metrics like CPU, memory, latency, and errors.
- Design dashboards and alerts that **match the underlying system behavior**, not just raw thresholds.

---

## 2. Prioritize High-Value Metrics

Focus on collecting and monitoring metrics that directly answer:

- Is the system available?
- Is it performing within expected parameters?
- Are there early signals of degradation?

Recommended metric categories:

| Category | Examples |
|:---------|:---------|
| Traffic | `http_requests_total`, `grpc_server_started_total` |
| Latency | `http_request_duration_seconds`, transaction durations |
| Errors | `http_5xx_errors_total`, application exceptions |
| Saturation | `process_cpu_seconds_total`, `node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes` |

---

## 3. Monitor Both Rate and Shape of Changes

- Use **rate of change** functions (`rate()`, `increase()`) to detect subtle problems early.
- Watch for **shape changes**:  
  - Linear → Power = Early bottleneck.  
  - Linear → Exponential = Imminent failure.

Understanding **how metrics change**, not just when they cross thresholds, improves detection quality.

---

## 4. Build Observability for Diagnosis, Not Just Alerting

- Dashboards should tell a **story** about system health:
  - Traffic patterns
  - Latency distributions
  - Error trends
  - Resource consumption paths
- Enable fast **root cause isolation**, not just incident notification.

Good observability **accelerates mean time to detect (MTTD)** and **mean time to resolve (MTTR)**.

---

## 5. Use Multi-Layered Alerting Strategies

- **Linear threshold alerts** for normal growth patterns.
- **Rate-of-change alerts** for catching sudden spikes.
- **Power/Exponential modeling alerts** for detecting performance degradation or cascading failures.
- **Logarithmic flattening alerts** for tracking optimization effectiveness over time.

Use different alerting techniques depending on the **metric behavior**.

---

## 6. Always Correlate Metrics, Logs, and Traces

- **Metrics** show *what* is happening (quantitative).
- **Logs** explain *why* it is happening (qualitative).
- **Traces** reveal *where* and *how long* issues are happening across services.

Integrate **metrics + logs + traces** into single dashboards whenever possible.

---

## 7. Optimize for Understandability

- Name metrics clearly (`http_server_latency_seconds`, not `hsl_s`).
- Tag logs and metrics with meaningful labels: service name, operation, environment.
- Keep dashboards focused and simple:
  - 6–10 panels per view maximum.
  - Top-level metrics first, drilldowns second.

Observability is for humans first, machines second.

---

## 8. Review and Evolve Observability Regularly

- **Validate alert thresholds** after major releases or architecture changes.
- **Refactor dashboards** if they become cluttered.
- **Remove obsolete metrics and logs** to reduce noise.
- **Perform post-incident observability reviews**:  
  - What signals were missing?  
  - What metrics helped the most?

Observability must **evolve with your system**.
