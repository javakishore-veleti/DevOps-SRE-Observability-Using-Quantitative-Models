# Grafana Dashboards for DevOps and SRE Observability

This folder contains Grafana dashboards focused on monitoring service behavior using Linear, Power, and Exponential modeling techniques. These dashboards help DevOps and SRE teams track system growth, detect performance degradations, and predict failures early.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| **exponential-failure-alerts-dashboard.json** | Tracks exponential growth patterns like sudden error spikes and cascading failures. Useful for early failure detection. |
| **linear-growth-dashboard.json** | Observes steady, predictable growth in key metrics such as CPU usage, HTTP traffic, and memory usage. Ideal for capacity planning. |
| **power-load-dashboard.json** | Visualizes how system performance degrades under heavy load. Detects when resource usage increases faster than traffic. |

## Dashboards Overview

### exponential-failure-alerts-dashboard.json
- **Monitor 5xx Error Rates Over Time**.
- **Alert on exponential growth in application exceptions**.

### linear-growth-dashboard.json
- **Track CPU, Memory, and HTTP traffic** under normal, steady growth conditions.
- **Identify when resources approach critical thresholds**.

### power-load-dashboard.json
- **Analyze Response Time vs Request Load**.
- **Spot non-linear scaling issues and early saturation points**.

## Usage

1. Open Grafana.
2. Go to **Dashboards â†’ Import**.
3. Upload the desired `.json` file.
4. Map the correct Prometheus data source when prompted.
5. Customize thresholds if needed based on your environment.

> **Note:**  
> Ensure your Prometheus metrics align with expressions like `http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration_seconds`, and `process_cpu_seconds_total`.

## Objective

These dashboards are designed to:

- Apply **Quantitative Modeling** (Linear, Power, Exponential) directly to observability.
- Detect **early warning signals** in system performance.
- Help **DevOps and SRE teams** respond to both predictable growth and unexpected anomalies.
